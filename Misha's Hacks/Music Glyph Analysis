Analysis: to use vector indices or not.


Case 1: Vertices only

6 vertices rectangle, 4 floats per vertex (inc texture coord), 4 bytes/float => 84 bytes

Case 2: Index

4 vertices/rectangl, 4 floats/vertex, 4 bytes/float = 64 bytes
6 indices /rect , 2 bytes/index = 12 bytes

Total: 76 bytes.

Index solution is marginally more space efficient, although probably slightly more
time inefficient due to the indexing overhead. On the other hand, indexing is probably
very fast.

Let's go with the indexing solution.
